  ## Project Description

  This project is a CMS-style Tech blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. I have followed the  MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
