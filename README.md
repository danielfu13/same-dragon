  ## Project Description

  This task for this project was to use starter code that is fully functioning with Google Books API search engine build with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
